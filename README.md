This is an example meta layer used for building SD Image for Raspberry Pi 3B+ device that enabled the following functionalities:

- IoT Hub Device Update Agent
  - SWUpdate and SWUpdate V2 handlers
  - Script handler
  - Delta Downloader (for Delta-update support)
  - Device Update data partition (/adu)
- Delivery Optimization Agent
- Custom swupdate that supports:
  - zstd compression
  - custom hardware compat file (/etc/adu-swupdate-hw-compat)
- Dual-partition (A/B) Update
  - adu-raspberrypi.wks creates 2 file system partitions to support A/B update.

In addition, this layer also produces SWU file that can be used for updating the previous version of the image, using swupdate tool.

# Recipes

This layer contains the following recipes:

| Recipe Name      | Description |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| recipes-bsp | Customizes `uboot` script to support A/B update strategy. This is required for SWUpdate Handler (for demonstration or reference purposes). |
| recipes-core | Customizes `ftab` to add the 2nd root file system partition (for A/B update strategy) and Device Update data partition (/adu).<br/>This recipe also defines what is included in the base image (adu-base-image).  |
| recipes-extended | This recipe defines what is included in the .swu file (adu-update-image).|
| recipes-graphics | Includes graphics component for the target device. |
| recipes-support | Creates a customized version of swupdate tool that enabled configurations required by SWUpdate Handler and the Delta Downloader. |
| wic | For .wic format support. |
